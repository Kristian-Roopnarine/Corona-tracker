There have been no cases of SARS since 2003.", "While SARS-CoV-2 originated in a wild animal market in Wuhan, China, the risk of catching a new coronavirus from animals remains very low. However, care should always be taken when handling raw meat, milk, or animal organs. Always ensure foods are properly cooked before consuming. (WHO)", "There is only one documented case of a dog being infected with SARS-CoV-2, so there is little evidence that pets can spread the disease. However, you should still wash your hands after handling pets, especially after walking your dog. Dogs could still contact contaminated surfaces and carry the virus externally.

The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.

Studies have shown that the virus is detectable for up to two weeks on hard surfaces, but survives for less time on porous surfaces like clothing and cardboard. (WHO)", "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don\u2019t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. (WHO)", "COVID-19 is more serious than the seasonal flu for multiple reasons.

(WHO)", "The incubation period for COVID-19 ranges from 1 to 14 days, meaning it can take this long to start showing symptoms after initial infection. Some studies have shown that you are the most contagious during the early stages of the disease. This is why social distancing is so important to prevent asymptomatic transmission.", "SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets, which do not hang in the air for a long time. Therefore, the risk of airborne transmission is low when maintaining at least 6 feet of distance.
